# Output Interface and Grid Link – Real-World Power Routing System

This document describes the **real-world energy output path** from internal Tesla coil collection and ZeroCell storage to compliant grid injection into Germany's national power system.

All components follow:
- **DIN VDE 0126-1-1** (Germany PV + alt energy grid-connection)
- **IEC 62116** anti-islanding protocols
- CE + RoHS compliant hardware

## ⚡ Key Hardware Interfaces

### 1. **Tesla Coil Output Terminals**
- Output: Pulsed high-voltage EM bursts
- Rectified via **multistage silicon-carbide (SiC) diodes** (for ultrafast recovery)
- Downconverted to stable DC bus (~950V DC peak)

---

### 2. **ZeroCell Buffer Node**
- Absorbs surges (acts like a harmonic capacitor + EM sponge)
- Trickle discharges to DC rail over 5–7 minutes post-strike
- Prevents grid shock or voltage surge reflection

---

### 3. **Hybrid DC Isolation Relay**
- 3-layer redundancy:
  - Mechanical breaker
  - Solid-state relay
  - Arc quench snubber net
- Auto-disconnects during overload, lightning misfire, or EMI spike

---

### 4. **Grid-Tied Inverter Specs**

**Recommended Model:**
- SMA Sunny Tripower CORE2 or Fronius Tauro Eco 100-3
- Rated input: 800–1000V DC
- Output: 400V 3-phase AC @ 50 Hz
- Max output per inverter: ~100kW

**Mounting Notes:**
- Inverter units installed in base vault or side housing
- German-language safety labeling required

**Compliance:**
- DIN VDE 0126-1-1 (includes islanding protection, sync phase lock)
- Certified to connect to EnWG-compliant nodes

---

### 5. **Transformer Step (Optional)**

If grid voltage mismatch:
- Use step-up transformer (e.g. 400V → 20kV) depending on local node
- Solid dielectric core (oil-free) preferred for seawater proximity

---

## 🧪 Output Verification & Testing

- Internal inverter logs output pulse timing, voltage, and fault events
- Real-time telemetry transmitted to master control node via LoRa or fiber
- Ground-loop protection integrated into final output path

---

## 🛡️ Surge, Arc, and EMI Safety

- All outputs shielded via:
  - EM braid wrapping
  - Ferrite ring chokes
  - Faraday wall interface panel

**Thermal Sink Strategy:**
- Passive radiator fins for inverter cooling
- Backup forced-air exchange if temp > 70°C

## ✅ Summary

This output system translates raw natural chaos into **grid-stable, legal, civilian power** — using nothing but known hardware, certified parts, and existing legal frameworks.

> There’s nothing theoretical here. The grid won’t care how the power was born — only that it behaves.
