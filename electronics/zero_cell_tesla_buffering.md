# ⚡ ZeroCell-Tesla Coil Buffering and Grid Handoff Schematic

This document outlines the electrical buffering system between the lightning-struck Tesla coil stacks and the output capacitor bank. It ensures that the captured high-voltage pulses are stabilized, harmonized, and regulated before transmission to local infrastructure or storage.

| Spark Gaps | Auto-calibrated based on real-time humidity | Tungsten-electrode |
| ZeroCell Buffers | EM flux dampening, modulated by field-coherent ferrites | Ferrite + quartz + graphite |
| Rectifier Stack | Ultrafast diodes in parallel-arrayed configuration | SiC + tungsten base |
| Capacitor Tank | Multi-bank supercapacitor matrix | Carbon polymer or ultracapacitors |
| Grid Interface | Output inverter tuned to 50Hz (Europe) | Siemens/Mitsubishi-grade inverter |

## 🧪 Function Breakdown

- **Tesla Coils**: Convert bolt into staged harmonic resonance.
- **Spark Gaps**: Bleed unstable peaks and normalize arc length.
- **ZeroCell**: Create temporal damping field to prevent thermal runaway and EM recoil.
- **Rectifier**: Convert chaotic HV pulses to regulated DC.
- **Capacitor Tank**: Temporarily stores energy before inverter logic hands off to city or microgrid.

## 📐 Wiring Logic

- **Input Path**: All three towers feed their rods through respective Tesla coil chains, wired in a 3-point triangular harmonic loop.
- **Coil Array**: Configured in triplets—each with its own spark gap + ZeroCell.
- **Bus Sync**: Final output rails converge to a shared capacitor tank per tower.
- **Gankyil Sync Layer**: High-impedance coils lock to each other using harmonic phasing to allow uniform loading during simultaneous strikes.

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

- Use flame-retardant cable jackets (polyethylene-based preferred).
- Ground plane mesh must be embedded at least 5m below tower base.
- Optical isolation between towers prevents backfeed.
